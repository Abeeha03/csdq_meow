    researchDesc:
      "Kapoutsisâ€™ main research area is the size complexity of two-way finite automata (2FA). Since 2001, he has worked extensively on the so-called Sakoda-Sipser conjecture. This is a question about the power of non-determinism in size-limited 2FA, which can be viewed as a miniature version of complexity theory's deep open questions on the power of non-determinism. Since 2009, he has also been working on a general size-complexity theory for 2FA, which he likes to call 'minicomplexity'. Here, the aim is to show that many properties of computation that we observe in standard complexity theory emerge already in machines as weak as the 2FA.",

In the past 25 years, he has been working on a number of research topics in the domains of parallel and distributed computing, artificial intelligence, swarm intelligence, combinatorial optimization, telecommunication networks, modeling of biological systems, autonomous robotics, distributed and swarm robotics, and human-robot interaction. He co-authored the work that laid down the formal foundations of the Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic, and he developed algorithms that are de facto the main references for swarm intelligence in network optimization. Di Caro has co-authored pioneering research in swarm robotics, in particular networked swarms and human-swarm interaction. His recent work focuses on planning and coordination in mobile multi-robot systems, integration of networking and control, and use of learning techniques for robot recognition and navigation tasks. In a new research project, he will explore various interaction and coordination issues in heterogeneous teams of autonomous aerial and aquatic robots.",

Formal verification of software, hardware, or any other type of system, is used to provide strong guarantees (i.e., proofs) that the system satisfies certain properties, thus making them more reliable and robust. Examples of such properties include: specification and requirements are satisfied, data is kept confidential, or certain bugs will never occur. Such methodology is especially valuable for safety-critical systems (e.g., in health, nuclear power, or aviation), in which an error could be catastrophic.",
