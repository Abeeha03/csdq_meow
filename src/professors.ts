      "Kapoutsisâ€™ main research area is the size complexity of two-way finite automata (2FA). Since 2001, he has worked extensively on the so-called Sakoda-Sipser conjecture. This is a question about the power of non-determinism in size-limited 2FA, which can be viewed as a miniature version of complexity theory's deep open questions on the power of non-determinism. Since 2009, he has also been working on a general size-complexity theory for 2FA, which he likes to call 'minicomplexity'. Here, the aim is to show that many properties of computation that we observe in standard complexity theory emerge already in machines as weak as the 2FA.",

To trigger a similar scale of transformation indoors, this thesis investigates methods that can be used to take widely available, engineering-class layout files of indoor spaces (known as CAD drawings, often exported to flattened PNG images), and convert them into a navigable representation that represents the information necessary to supplement systems that wish to map a located person to an area indoors and utilize our representation to navigate users from one indoor area to another. Through experimentation with existing indoor representation formats, we determine our navigable representation to be in the form of a graph structure that takes key indoor areas as its nodes and navigable links as its edges.

        description:
          "Advancements in 3D sensing technologies have led to an increased reliance on point cloud data for diverse applications ranging from autonomous navigation to environmental modeling. However, the sheer volume of data collected by these technologies poses significant challenges for real-time processing and analysis. This thesis introduces SampleLapNet, a novel neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of point cloud downsampling in a task-agnostic manner. By leveraging the Laplacian operator as a geometric measure of point importance, SampleLapNet learns to predict and preserve critical geometric features during the downsampling process, thereby ensuring minimal loss of relevant information. The architecture combines the robustness of transformer models with the efficiency of Laplacian-based importance scoring to facilitate efficient preprocessing that enhances subsequent point cloud analyses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SampleLapNet through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in downsampling efficiency without compromising the performance of downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. This work not only proposes a method to reduce computational demands but also provides insights into the geometric processing of 3D data, suggesting pathways for future innovations in point cloud processing.",

However, usability is still a major concern when it comes to introducing students to such systems. In this paper, we present Silkie, a system with an intuitive interface that would allow instructors to use proof assistants in undergraduate computer science education. It is built using SMLtoCoq, which translates SML code into Coq definitions, and an adapted version of JSCoq, a web-based implementation of the Coq theorem prover. Silkie is especially useful in courses that require students to write code and formally prove its correctness. Students can upload SML code into Silkie, and see the corresponding Coq definitions, which they can then use to prove properties about. The proof tactics were modified such that 'simple' steps that are typically expected from students need to be explicit, and the language resembles more what would be written on paper. Moreover, the interface will structure the proof script depending on the commands used, such that the hierarchy of each proof part is clear.",

          "Federated Learning (FL) enabled creating models that are competitive to centralized Machine Learning models while preserving privacy by allowing clients to train data locally. Despite FL research growth, most of the work assessment and existing open-source FL testbeds/frameworks have drawbacks that prohibit convenient deployment over a large spectrum of heterogeneous clients in realistic environments. These drawbacks include simulations, unrealistic datasets, not supporting heterogeneity, and not having a realistic environment control in terms of network and client churn, for example. In this paper, we introduce RealFL, a novel, realistic, open-source, and extendable platform for FL that supports a large scale of heterogeneous clients. It enables realistic assessment of FL solutions by controlling various environmental parameters; e.g., network, client churn, data distribution, training complexity, and client heterogeneity. Using these parameters, we assess RealFL performance through an extensive evaluation. The results show a performance gap of up to 77.5% in training time and 23.9% in accuracy between FL unrealistic environments and RealFL.",

It promises a huge leap forward in the time needed for solving a handful of important applied problems such as prime factorization, machine learning, quantum simulations, search, optimization, and many more. We tried to relate quantum computing methods to indoor localization problems. It is a problem of estimating objectsâ€™ location where the ordinary outdoor systems cannot be easily deployed because of obstacles for a transmitted signal. The potential improvements of exploiting quantum computing in solving this problem could increase accuracy and decrease the time required for location determination. We have found a preprint with a cosine similarity-based quantum algorithm for indoor localization that is exponentially better in both time and space than its classical version. In this report, we present our preliminary results in improving upon this algorithm that gives constant improvements with respect to the number of shots required.",
